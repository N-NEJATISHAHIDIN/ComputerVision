    "As we discussed in class, to make a panorama we need to reproject the images onto a sphere, something you will be implementing in this question. I have given you some starter code that you should use to reproject the image onto a sphere: the function `reproject_image_to_sphere`. I have annotated what you need to include to complete this function:\n",

    "\n",
    "**TASK** Complete the `reproject_image_to_sphere` function I have provided below. I recommend that you revisit the lecture slides on panoramas to get the definitions of the unit sphere coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have provided you with a simple scene for Blender: `simple_pano_env.blend`. The camera is located at `x=0` and `y=0` and oriented such that it is level with the ground plane and rotated 0-degrees about the z-axis. The only camera in the scene has a Focal Length of 40 mm (expressed with respect to the *36 mm* film size standard used in photography). To test that your image reprojection method is working correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TASK** Generate 4 images by changing the Focal Length of the camera in Blender and name them as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `b_pano_20mm.png` Rendered after setting the camera Focal Length to `20 mm`.\n",
    "2. `b_pano_30mm.png` Rendered after setting the camera Focal Length to `30 mm`.\n",

    "4. `b_pano_50mm.png` Rendered after setting the camera Focal Length to `50 mm`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plots** Run the `Evaluation and Plotting` code I have included below. This will generate three figures (all of which you should include in your writeup). (1) shows the four images after the spherical reprojection. (2) shows the images added together, showing that in the center where all images have visibility of the scene, the images properly overlap. (3) The \"differences\" between consecutive Focal Lengths; if your code is implemented well, the center region (where the two overlap) should be nearly zero (\"white\" in the color scheme) and large outside of that image (where they do not overlap).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the second plot, in which all images have been added together, looks \"reasonable\" (that the images are properly overlapped with one another) and you are convinced that your reprojection function is working properly, you can move on to the next section, in which you are asked to build your own panoramas after reprojecting onto a sphere."

    "# P4.2 Panorama Stitching\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, you will be building a panorama from images you generate from Blender. This will involve three steps: (1) image generation, (2) image transform estimation, and (3) stitching.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TASK** Generate images from Blender. To do this, you may using the `simple_pano_env.blend` environment that I have provided you with. By rotating the camera (done by modifying the rotation about its Z-axis). You should set the Focal length of the camera to `40 mm` and sweep the rotation from +40 degrees to -60 degrees; you should rotate the camera in increments such that consecutive images have an overlap of roughly 1/3. You will likely need to generate roughly 5 or 6 images in this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PLOTS** Reproject the images using the `reproject_image_to_sphere` function from the previous question and compute the translation transform between each pair of \"consecutive images\" (images next to one another in angle space) using OpenCV. For each pair of matched images \n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the transformation, you may use the same [OpenCV Homography tutorial from the last assignment](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d1/de0/tutorial_py_feature_homography.html). However, we know that the transformation is a translation, and so we do not want to allow the system to generate a general homography matrix, which is what results with `cv.findHomography`. Instead, you should use `affine_mat = cv.estimateAffinePartial2D(src_pts, dst_pts)[0]`, which returns a `2x3` matrix (you will need to convert this to a `3x3` homography by adding a row of `[0, 0, 1]`) that only allows for scale, rotation, and translation. Create a new transformation matrix that includes only the estimated translation parameters. Using this procedure should be more numerically stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PLOT** Create the panorama and include it in a plot! To do this you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pad all images to the size of the output panorama (you will need to determine how wide this will need to be).\n",
    "2. Apply the transformation matrices (using `cv.warpPerspective`) to the images to move them \"into place\" (the location they will be in the resulting panorama). This means that you will need to apply `translation_mat_2_to_1` (or its inverse) to shift image 2 relative to image 1. Note that moving image 3 into place will require accounting for the translation between 2 and 3 *and* the translation between 1 and 2, and so on. You should prefer to multiply the transformation matrices together before using them to transform the image.\n",
    "3. Combine the images to make the panorama. You do not need to use any of the \"fancy\" blending techniques we discussed in class. Simply using `np.maximum` between the two images will create a sufficient panorama. Small artifacts from merging are acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PLOT** Finally, add the 20 mm focal length image you generated as part of the previous question to your panorama. It might be interesting to see how the significant change in field of view reveals more of the panorama at once and more of the space above and below the horizon."
